# emoX-text
Explorations into the subject of linguistic expressions of emotional events documented in the Empathetic Dialogues dataset (ED; Rashkin et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00207.pdf)). As its name suggests, the ED dataset is often used for the purpose of empatheic dialog systems. Yet, there is also an attribute of the ED dataset that is particularly valuable in allowing us to gain deeper insights into the psycholinguistic aspects of emotions. In particular, the creators of the ED dataset provided people with an emotion word, and had them describe a situation associated with that word. Similar to word assocation tests within the domain of psychology and cognitive science, the emotion-situation relation in ED can provide us with some clues about the associative links between episodic memory and emotion concepts (i.e., how emotion words trigger memories of events/situations).

Some information on the dataset: 

There are a total of 32 "emotion classes". Details pertaining to these classes specific to the ED dataset is in Figure 3 of Rashkin et al. ([2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00207.pdf)). 

There are a total of n events that participants provided, split into the conventional train, test.


Some thoughts about "emotion classes": This phrases is in parentheses because the state of emotion research, at this juncture, do not permit a precise formulation of the space and structure governing the emotion concept. A thorough review is beyond the scope of this README. Nonetheless, the following are starting points to understand how we can think about emotion and its related concept:

Given the heterogeniety in the essence of what emotions are, and the disparate worlds of thoughts by which emotion researchers inhabit, I explore "emotion categoty agnostic" methods to understand the current dataset
